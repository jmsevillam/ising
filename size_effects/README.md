# Ising Model

## Critical Temperature Characterization and Size Effects


The ising model on this perspective, as well as many other simulations, is filled with size effects. To be able to get the correct result on the thermodynamic limit, it is necessary to make an extrapolation from finite sizes.

Hence, we will consider different sizes and different temperatures. We consider for the results here displayed an ensemble of 50 different (and independent) configurations for each size and 101 different temperatures on a range $[0,4]$ on ising units.

All simulations were stabilized at a given temperature, and then the magetization was calculated. Further the temperature was increased and the process was repeated again.

In this case, as the considerations done were built for only temperature dependence, it was not necessary consider independent initial configurations at each new temperature as there is no possibility for hysteresis to occur as it does for the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization below the critical temperature. But it is important, however, that the very initial configuration has to be taken so that the space invariance is broken (We may force the system to break this symmetry), as otherwise clusters are likely to occur, as they are stable on a finite sistem.
